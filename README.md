# Axette

Very simple and lightweight AJAX implementation for [Nette](https://nette.org)

## Install

### With npm:

```
npm install axette
```

### With yarn:

```
yarn add axette
```

### With `<script>` tag / via CDN:

```
yarn add axette
```

## Usage

Just call `registerAjaxHandlers` anywhere after the page is loaded and that's it! Everything else must be handled server-side by Nette and proper use of `{snippet}` tags.
